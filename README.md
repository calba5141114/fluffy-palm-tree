##### Why Express (Server Framework)
Express is the server framework I am most comfortable working 
with on a daily basis, it is stable and contains a lot of nice modules
for hosting static files and endpoints.
##### Why Mongo? (Database)
I wanted to store url mappings as key pair values in 
memory but also wanted to maintain a basic persistence layer. 
Since Mongo can run as an in memory Database and is MultiCored 
it's great for the Job. I would have used Redis for sheer performance
but it just does not support MapReduce
